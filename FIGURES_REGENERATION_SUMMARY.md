# Individual Figures Regeneration - Complete Summary

## ✅ Task Completed Successfully!

All multi-subfigure plots from both exploration notebooks have been regenerated as **individual, high-quality figures** with clear, readable text.

---

## 📊 What Was Done

### Problem
- Both `data_exploration.ipynb` and `more_exploration.ipynb` contained multi-subfigure plots (3x3, 2x3, 2x2 grids)
- Small subfigures had tiny text (10-12pt), making them hard to read
- Combined figures were difficult to use individually in reports/presentations

### Solution
Created `regenerate_individual_figures.py` script that:
1. Loads all AIDev dataset tables
2. Calculates all metrics (files per PR, lines added/deleted, commits, reviews, etc.)
3. Generates **30 individual high-quality figures** (12x8 inches at 300 DPI)
4. Uses **larger, bold text** (14-18pt fonts)
5. Saves each figure with **meaningful, numbered names**

## 🎨 Quality Improvements

### Before (Multi-Subfigure Plots)
- ❌ Small text (10-12pt)
- ❌ Cramped layout (3x3, 2x3 grids)
- ❌ Hard to read labels
- ❌ Generic filenames (`pr_distributions.png`)
- ❌ Subfigures not usable individually

### After (Individual Figures)
- ✅ **Large text (14-18pt, bold)**
- ✅ **Spacious layout (12x8 inches)**
- ✅ **Clear, readable labels**
- ✅ **Meaningful names** (`01_pr_files_changed_histogram.png`)
- ✅ **Each figure standalone**
- ✅ **300 DPI resolution**
- ✅ **Value labels on bar charts**

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start
To regenerate all figures (if data changes):
```bash
cd /Users/tayyibgondal/Desktop/autonomous_coding_agents_in_software_engineering
python regenerate_individual_figures.py
```

### In LaTeX Reports
```latex
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures_individual/01_pr_files_changed_histogram.png}
\caption{Distribution of files changed per pull request showing median of X and mean of Y}
\label{fig:pr_files}
\end{figure}
```

### In Markdown
```markdown
![Files Changed per PR](figures_individual/01_pr_files_changed_histogram.png)
```

### In Presentations
- All figures are 300 DPI - suitable for projection
- Bold text is readable even on large screens
- Can be used directly in PowerPoint/Keynote

## 🔄 Original Notebooks

The original notebooks (`data_exploration.ipynb` and `more_exploration.ipynb`) remain unchanged. They still contain the multi-subfigure code for reference. You can:

- **Option 1**: Keep using the script to generate individual figures
- **Option 2**: Update notebook cells to use the individual figure generation code
- **Option 3**: Use both (combined overview + individual detailed figures)

---

## 📈 Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to update the notebooks themselves:
1. Replace multi-subplot cells with individual figure generation code
2. Add markdown cells explaining each figure
3. Link to the `figures_individual/` directory

Or simply run `regenerate_individual_figures.py` whenever you need updated figures!
